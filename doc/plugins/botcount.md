### Bot Counter (version 0.0.1)
Shows Bots Left Alive

[Plugin](plugins/botcount.smx?raw=true) - [Source](scripting/botcount.sp)

Displays a popup to players every 60 seconds by default identifying remaining enemy players alive. Beginning of a "UAV" feature, my goal is to create an entity on the map that can be used to get this information rather than just spamming it. Release ready, no known bugs.

#### CVAR List
 * sm_botcount_enabled: sets whether bot naming is enabled (default: 0)
 * sm_botcount_timer: Frequency to show count (default: 60)
