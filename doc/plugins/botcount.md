### Bot Counter (version 0.0.1)
Shows Bots Left Alive

 * [Plugin - botcount.smx](plugins/botcount.smx?raw=true)
 * [Source - botcount.sp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredballou/insurgency-sourcemod/master/scripting/botcount.sp)

Displays a popup to players every 60 seconds by default identifying remaining enemy players alive. Beginning of a "UAV" feature, my goal is to create an entity on the map that can be used to get this information rather than just spamming it. Release ready, no known bugs.

#### CVAR List
 * "sm_botcount_enabled" "0" //sets whether bot naming is enabled
 * "sm_botcount_timer" "60" //Frequency to show count
