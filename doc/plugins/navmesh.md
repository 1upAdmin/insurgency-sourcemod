### SourcePawn Navigation Mesh Parser (version 1.0.3)
A plugin that can read Valve's Navigation Mesh.

 * [Plugin - navmesh.smx](plugins/navmesh.smx?raw=true)
 * [Source - navmesh.sp](scripting/navmesh.sp)

Navmesh parser, created by KitRifty and modified by me to support Hiding Spots and other natives that were missing.
